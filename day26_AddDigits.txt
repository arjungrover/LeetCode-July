/*
we need to add digits untill we get single digit.
we need to find one magic number which can give our single digit in 1 step.

n=38 3+8=11 = 1+1 = 2
38%k == 11%k == 2%k

Lets say we got number n which can be expressed in terms of pow(10);
Lets assume our magic number is k;   
if we divide n%k = r (remainder) ; [ multiple of k +r = n ]
if we divide sum of digits of n: sum(n)%k = r (remainder)  

we need to find that magic number k;

since both equation got r as remainder; we can subtract both terms in order to delete extra r and then divide it by our magic number k; it will give remainder zero.

n=18102

(10000+8000+100+2) - (1+8+1+0+2) = 9*10^3 + 9*10^2+.... = we can say it is completely divisible by 9.

9 = [0-8] remainder possible 
it covers everything.
